## 📝 INTERPRETATION GUIDE

### **Reading Character Evolution Charts:**
- **Steep upward slopes:** Rapid character growth (look for catalyst episodes)
- **Plateaus:** Stable character phase (consolidation period)
- **Downward trends:** Regression or strategic retreat (rare but significant)

**Example:** Alessandra's confidence jumps from 3→6 between Ep 20-33 because of:
- Episode 21: Horse excrement revenge
- Episode 22: Physical confrontation with Katrina
- Episode 23: Demands stolen inheritance
- Episode 33: Survives abduction attempt

### **Reading Relationship Charts:**
- **Parallel lines:** Balanced relationship growth
- **Diverging lines:** Tension or imbalance
- **Converging lines:** Resolution or harmony

**Example:** Edgar & Alessandra's intimacy and trust lines converge at Ep 89 (consummation) - physical and emotional intimacy finally aligned.

### **Reading Power Dynamics:**
- **Score of 2-4:** Antagonist has power over Alessandra
- **Score of 5-6:** Power struggle, uncertain outcome
- **Score of 7-8:** Alessandra gaining advantage
- **Score of 9-10:** Alessandra has complete power (victory)

**Note:** Score of 10 can mean different things:
- Kate (Ep 21): Alessandra humiliated her, power inverted
- Desmond (Ep 34): Alessandra ordered his execution
- Priscilla (Ep 93): Alessandra defeated her financially
